# Travel form website with PHP and MySQL database.

PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-Processor. The PHP software works with the webserver, which is the software that delivers web pages.
<br>
When you need any information from the internet, you type in the information into your web browser (REQUEST), web browser creates a URL. It sends a message to the webserver at that URL, asking it to send you the HTML file, CSS file, JavaScript file. The web server RESPONDS by sending the requested file. Your browser reads the HTML file and displays the web page. This is how websites work.
